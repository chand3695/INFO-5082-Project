INFO 5082 Project Proposal

1.	Project Title:
Netflix Movie Recommendation System

2.	 Introduction and Background of the project:

Have you ever thought about why the Netflix craftsmanship changes for various shows when you log in to the account? One day it very well may be a picture of the whole scaffold group while a day or two ago it is the Worf frowning at you judgingly. On the off chance that you are a Netflix user, you may likewise have seen that the stage shows truly exact types like Romantic Dramas where the main character is left-given. How does Netflix concoct such exact kinds for its 100 million or more supporter base? How does Netflix work of art change? It's AI and the innovativeness in the background that think about what will make a client pick a specific show to watch. AI and information science assist Netflix with customizing the experience for you dependent on your set of experiences of picking shows to watch.

The proposed project is to create movie recommendations to users based on the movies they rated highly. This recommendation will be for every user based on the user’s interest. I will be using algorithms like reinforcement learning, neural networks, casual modelling, probabilistic graphical models, matrix factorization.

3.	Statement of the Project Problem:

As indicated by McKinsey 75% of what individuals are watching on Netflix comes from suggestions. Netflix Real-time information cases in excess of 20,000 films and shows, 2 million clients. 

The principle thought behind this project is to utilize shared separating that thinks about client's conclusions on various recordings and prescribe the best video to every client dependent on the client's past rankings and the assessment of comparable kinds of clients.

4.	 Related Work:

Model-based algorithms first construct a model to represent user behaviour and, therefore, to predict their ratings. The parameters of the model are estimated using the data from the rating matrix. There are many model-based approaches: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and SVD are based on algebra[6] , Bayes methods are based on statistics[8]. Matrix factorization for recommender systems has been a special focus of a voluminous amount of research, especially since the Netflix Prize competition was announced. This methodology transforms both items and users to the same latent factor space, thus making them directly comparable.

5.	Objective of the study:

Organizations like Netflix have a colossal information base of the practices of information gathered to have the option to perform condition of-craftsmanship proposals with the goal that they can show the most significant substance to the clients to expand the commitment. 

I would focus structure a suggestion model utilizing collaborative technique to prescribe films to users.
        6. Research design and methodology:
            The dataset is obtained from Kaggle website. It contains CustomerID, Rating, Date.
            MovieIDs range from 1 to 17770 sequentially. 
            CustomerIDs range from 1 to 2649429 there are 480189 users. 
            Ratings are on five star scale from 1 to 5.
            Dates have the format YYYY—MM—DD    
            The dataset consists of four text data files each file contains over 20M rows over 4K movies and 400K customers. 

7. Dataset:
   
    Netflix Prize Dataset
 
    The original dataset has been collected from Kaggle here’s the link for the original dataset from Data World:

                 8. Conclusion:
Building recommendation framework has it's own advantages , the recommendation model means to give the generally pertinent and relatable data to a client relying upon the conduct of the client. With the development of large information age across different fields, data over-burden is turning into a basic issue. To address this, various Recommendation Systems (RS) have been created to help customers discover things of interest.
