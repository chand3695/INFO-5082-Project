INFO 5082 Project Proposal

Netflix Recommendation System
A recommendation system generates a compiled list of items in which a user might be interested, in the reciprocity of their current selection of item(s). It expands usersâ€™ suggestions without any disturbance or monotony, and it does not recommend items that the user already knows.
For instance, the Netflix recommendation system offers recommendations by matching and searching similar users' habits and suggesting movies that share characteristics with films that users have rated highly. The goal of the project is to develop a recommendation system for Netflix.

Netflix Dataset:
Combine_data_2.txt : this text file contains movie_id, customer_id, rating, date
Movie_title.csv: this csv file contains movie_id and movie_title.

Literature Review: This project deals with tools and programming languages that I learned in my masters. I will be using python libraries to do the analysis. I would like to perform Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization , Linear Regression and create Machine Learning Model.

The main steps in project:
Data Cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis
Building Recommendation System
